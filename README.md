# Full-Stack-App
Frontend built-in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS using a Python Flask backend with MongoDB and authentication.

I created an automated program to get myself Chipotle promo codes. I wanted to challenge myself so I created this full-stack application to access my promo codes on the go in a secure but easy-to-use way. This project was great to learn, and I feel better prepared to tackle further full stack-requiring problems I may face down the road.
